      "description": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and often severe viral disease affecting birds, particularly domestic poultry like chickens. It's caused by a virulent strain of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). The disease can cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry due to high mortality rates and production drops. The symptoms are mainly divided into 4 types as Respiratory(Difficulty breathing, coughing, gasping, nasal discharge), Nervous(Tremors, paralysis, incoordination, head tilt), Digestive(Diarrhea (often green), loss of appetite), General(Depression, lethargy, decreased egg production, soft-shelled eggs, sudden death). Newcastle Disease Vaccine, B1 Type, LaSota Strain, has been shown to be effective for the vaccination of healthy chickens 1 day, 2 weeks or 4 weeks of age and older against Newcastle Disease.",

The symptoms are Respiratory Signs [Sneezing, Coughing (typically dry, honking), Tracheal rales (rattling sounds in the throat), Nasal discharge (often watery and clear), Respiratory distress (difficulty breathing)], General Signs [Watery eyes, Depression and decreased activity] and sometimes it can affect other organs, leading to kidney damage, reproductive tract disorders, and decreased weight gain in broilers. Bronchitis Vaccine will be given first in the hatchery at 1 day of age and booster vacination is given usually at 2-3 weeks of age.",
